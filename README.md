It's one thing to search for recipes based on taste and diet. It's another to discover the recipe caters for more or less portions than intended. In the end, you're left with leftover ingredients and wonder what else you can make with them.

Kitchen Geek helps people discover recipes based on available ingredients or additional filters. Adjust and bookmark your favourite recipes.

## Lessons Learned

This project was a great opportunity for me to stretch, hone and develop new skills.

### Learnings

- Discovered React's `{children}` prop works similarly to Sass' `@content` [content block](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/mixin#content-blocks) feature.

- Spent 4 hours creating search parameter function. I later discovered React Router DOM has a built-in `useSearchParams` function that does the same thing.

- Explored using variable fonts _(thanks to [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell/featured))_. This saved time defining multiple fonts and helped reduce file size.

- I learnt how to create custom react modals (via [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuqU904ZHA4)).

- Creating functional tabbed content component (via [The Web School](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkREeDy2WQ4))

### Challenges

#### Time

I had two weeks to develop this project. In between, students from all courses were involved in a 24hr industry hackathon.

After the deadline, we had three days to apply finishing touches to our projects for demo day.

#### Search results _(with parameters)_

I wasn't sure how to route the search results page to accept parameters after the main search query. After reading the React Router DOM documentation, I learned to use the asterisk (`*`) after `results/` to accept all routes after it.

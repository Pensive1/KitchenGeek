## Lessons Learned

This project was a great opportunity for me to stretch, hone and develop new skills.

### Learnings

- Discovered Reacts `{children}` prop works similarly to Sass' `@content` [content block](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/mixin#content-blocks) feature.

- Spent 4 hours creating search parameter function. I later discovered React Router DOM has a built-in `useSearchParams` function that does the same thing.

- Explored using variable fonts _(thanks to [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell/featured))_. This saved time defining multiple fonts and helped reduce file size.

- I learnt how to create custom react modals (via [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuqU904ZHA4)).

- Creating functional tabbed content component (via [The Web School](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkREeDy2WQ4))

### Challenges

I wasn't sure how to route the search results page to accept parameters after the main search query. After reading the React Router DOM documentation, I learned to use the asterisk (`*`) after `results/` to accept all routes after it.
